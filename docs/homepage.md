## The Problem 

### Building Without Direction

As a solo technical founder, you face challenges that funded startups don't:

* **No co-founders** to bounce ideas off or spot your blindspots
* **Limited budget** for user research or professional feedback
* **Uncertain validation** if your landing page or MVP is on the right track
* **Echo chambers** of friends and family who won't give harsh truths
* **Wasted dev time** building features no one will use

Most technical founders spend weeks building the wrong thing because they lacked objective feedback at the crucial early stage.

## The Solution

### Pull Insights From Peers Who Get It

PeerPull connects you with other technical founders who understand what you're building. 

**Here's how it works:**
1. Submit your landing page or startup concept as a PullRequest
2. Give quality feedback to two other founders
3. Receive one thoughtful review in return—usually within hours
4. Iterate with confidence, knowing real founders have validated your direction

It's that simple. No marketing fluff, no generic advice—just targeted, technical feedback from people who speak your language.

## FAQ

**Q: How do you ensure quality feedback?**
A: All PeerInsights must be approved by recipients before the reviewer earns PeerPoints. Our templates also guide reviewers to provide specific, actionable insights rather than generic comments.

**Q: What if I don't have a landing page yet?**
A: You can still submit a concept document, pitch deck, or even a detailed description of your idea as a PullRequest. The key is having something concrete for others to evaluate.

**Q: How technical should the feedback be?**
A: Our community is primarily technical founders, so the feedback tends to be practical and implementation-focused. However, you can specify if you want feedback on specific aspects like market fit, UX, or technical architecture.

**Q: What if I'm an experienced founder without a current project?**
A: We welcome experienced founders to join as PeerPros! You'll get special recognition and can bank PeerPoints for future projects.

**Q: Is my idea protected?**
A: While we can't guarantee absolute confidentiality in a community setting, our terms prohibit stealing ideas. Remember that execution, not the idea itself, is typically the differentiator in startup success.
